📌 Project Title:
💹 Stock Portfolio Tracker Using Python

📖 Project Overview
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a Python-based console application that helps users simulate investing in shares of major companies. The user can input stock names and quantities, and the system calculates the total investment based on predefined prices. It also offers the option to save the investment summary to a text file. This project is ideal for beginners learning Python, especially input handling, data structures, and file operations.

🧠 Project Concept (Application Logic)
Although not a game, this program is built on simple and engaging logic:
 Users can choose from a list of companies (e.g., TCS, Infosys).
 For each valid entry, they provide the number of shares to “buy.”
 The total cost is calculated for each stock and accumulated.
 The user can save their portfolio summary to a text file.
